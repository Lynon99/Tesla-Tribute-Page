            <h3 id="opener">Here is some info about Tesla's Life:</h3>
            <ul id="list">
                <li id="li"><strong>1856</strong> - Born in Croatia</li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1875</strong> - Tesla enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College where he excelled at his studies and became intrested in the design of the electric motor. However he stopped studying and failed by his third year.</li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1881</strong> - After attending school in prague for a few years, Tesla moved to Budapest where he worked at a telephone exchange. He was made the chief electrician where he made many improvements to the equipment.</li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1882</strong> - Tesla started working at Edison Continental Company. He used his advanced knowledge of physics and engineering to deisgn electrical generators and motors. He later developed an arc lighting system, but his designs were never put into production. This was possible the result of improvements in incandesent lighting. Eventually, he quit working for Edison's company due to several unfavorable events with the managers, including not reciving bonuses.</li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1889</strong> - He traveled to an exposition in Paris and learned of Henrich Hertz's discovery of electromagnetic radiation. Tesla was enthralled by this discovery and decided to investigate further by buidling a coil.</li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1891</strong> - Tesla was awarded citizenship of the United States and also patented his Tesla Coil.</li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1895</strong> - After many years of lecturing and research, a lab fire broke out in his Broadway lab and more than 50,000 dollars worth of data and plans were destroyed. </li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1901</strong> - It was during this year that the famous Wardenclyffe tower began to be constructed. Although, the construction was never completed, his design proved a powerful concept that in many ways is continuing to have an effect on wireless electricity today.</li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1934</strong> - Reports came out about Teslas "death ray" which was an invention he designed that took advantage of electrostatic repulsion to charge metal particles and direct them in streams. </li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1943</strong> - Tesla died at the age of 86 in a New York hotel room. Shortly after, his research and items were seized by the U.S. Government.</li>
                <li id="li"><strong>1960</strong> - The scientific community recognized the Tesla as a measure of a magnetic field.</li>
