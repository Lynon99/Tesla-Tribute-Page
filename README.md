# Tesla-Tribute-Page

## This was a little project I did for FreeCodeCamp's responsive web design course. I was really inspired by Tesla's life and also his persistence to make his inventions come to life. Although, many of his inventions didn't come to fruition, I think his ideas and designs revolutionized the field of electrical egineering and continue to do so.
